Hello and Welcome to Dineovu - Cafe Application (where our application is you digital companion)

After Downloading the project run
# npm install vite --save-dev

To start the project open the terminal and run
# npm run dev

then open another terminal to start the backend server
tun the command
# cd server
to go to server directory

then install the node modules by running the command
# npm install

then run the command
# npm start
this will start the backend server

you also need to run the mongodb compass to get it connected with the connected
once you see in the backedn terminal that mongo db is connected
then you are good to go!

Now you can use both backend and frontend of the project

Go back to first terminal and there will be a link in the terminal
# copy the link and paste it in your browser to see the application in action
OR
you can use shortcut
# Ctrl + Click the link

You will go to the starting page of the application

You need to login or signup to continue using the application

After logging in you can use the application as your digital companion
throughout the entire course

There is only one miss and that is when you reload the page
the application will not be able to render the users profile as it is stored in redux state

This problem will be solved as soon as possible

Thank you for your understanding!
Enjoy the application and give feedback of your experience
